## üìå Description

This Python script demonstrates a full exploitation chain for the *Era* machine on Hack The Box. It performs:

- User login as `yuri`
- Reset of the `admin` account‚Äôs security questions
- Login as `admin` via security bypass
- Enumeration of available file IDs
- File upload (if no files were found on server)
- Triggering **remote code execution** via a misused `ssh2.exec` handler
- Optional automatic listener launch via `nc`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- HTB VPN connected
- `http://file.era.htb` added to `/etc/hosts`:

- Python 3.7+
- Required tools:
- `curl` (only for testing)
- `nc` (`netcat`) for reverse shell
- `requests` module (should be pre-installed)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
`python3 era_rce.py <your-IP> <your-port>`

If you want to skip automatic listener:

start netcat `nc -lvnp 5050` 

execute code `python3 era_rce.py 10.10.14.60 5050 --no-listen`
